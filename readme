Fir Network
===========

The Fir network is used for encrypted peer-to-peer communication. This includes
sending messages, files & commands to the other device. Each device can have
its own commands, for example a PC can have a volume selector which you can
change using your smartphone via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth without even leaving the
couch.
